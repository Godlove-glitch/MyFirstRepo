# My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

1. Master Git and GitHub Workflows
   I want to become fully comfortable using version control tools to manage all my coding projects.

2. Build Strong Python Skills
   I plan to deepen my Python knowledge, especially in data science and automation projects.

3. Work on Real-World Projects  
   I aim to complete at least 3 meaningful, beginner-to-intermediate level projects and upload them to GitHub.

4. Strengthen My Math for Data Science  
   I will review key concepts in statistics, probability, and algebra to support my data analysis skills.

5. Apply for University Programs 
   I plan to complete strong applications for programs that align with my goals in technology and innovation.

6. Contribute to Open Source (Even Small!) 
   Before the year ends, I want to make at least one meaningful contribution to an open-source project.

7. Stay Consistent and Reflect
   Iâ€™ll track my learning regularly and take time to reflect on both progress and challenges.
